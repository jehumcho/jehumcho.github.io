I am a PhD candidate at the Center for Operations Research and Econometrics (CORE), UCLouvain, under the supervision of [Anthony Papavasiliou](https://ap-rg.eu/). My interests include operations research, optimization under uncertainty, electricity market design, renewable energy integration in power systems, and stochastic programming.
